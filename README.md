## Differences from the book

It's a simple app from the third chapter of the book.

- All the class based components are transformed to **function components**
- Improve performance of ImageGrid component - reduce number of duplicate keys (there are still some duplicate warnings after a long scrolling but better than original code)
- Uses **React Hooks** in all of them
